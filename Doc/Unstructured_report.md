# Unsturctured Report

**PO:** - How should the system work?

**Costumer:** - I would like an application where users can get information about real weather data. I would like to query these data from a web API called Visual Crossing Weather. I would like users to be able to filter by city and they could choose whether they would like to receive a daily, weekly or a two weeks forecast. I would like the weather to be easy to determine based on small pictures. For example, if the sun is shining, instead of a text that the sun is shining, a small picture of a day should be displayed. And I want weather inspired colours in the user interface.

**PO:** - What do weather inspired colors mean?

**Costumer:** - I want weather-specific colors like yellow like the sun, blue like the sky, white like a cloud, or gray like a rain cloud. But I could also imagine a turquoise color.
